  tagline: Crafty. Web. Geek. 
  bio: 'My name is Kasey Bonifacio and I''m passionate about web development and love constantly learning new ways to make the web more awesome. Right now I am an apprentice at Sparkbox but before that, I had three years of frontend design and development under my belt. Once the apprenticeship is finished, I plan to be on the path to become a full-stack developer. When I can pry myself away from the computer, I can be found spending time with family, cooking, or being crafty.'
